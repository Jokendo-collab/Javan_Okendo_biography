## Javan Okendo brief biography
Javan Okendo completed his PhD at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in Professor Jonathan Blacknurn's laboratory.His PhD project main aim was to understand what constitutes protection and susceptibility to TB infections in humans. Javan is currently a **postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Shawn Burgess laboratory at the National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institute of Health, USA**. He also has an MSc degree in Bioinformatics from UCT, awarded with **distinction** in 2018. Javan has a passion for big data analysis and translation research which informs critical policies, specifically in health. Javan has worked as a Bioinformatics consultant for the Distributed Platform for Omics (DIPLOMICs) in Cape Town. He has also worked as a Bioinformatician with Novartis Pharma in Basel, Switzerland. Before that, he was a research assistant at the **Centre for Research in therapeutic sciences (CREATEs)**, Strathmore University, Kenya. Javan Okendo is a Kenyan citizen and a South African permanent resident. His personal mission is to develop individual and organizational capacities for positive societal transformation.
